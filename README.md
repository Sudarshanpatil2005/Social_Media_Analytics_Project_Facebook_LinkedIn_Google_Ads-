# Social_Media_Analytics_Project_Facebook_LinkedIn_Google_Ads-
This project delivers a full analytical breakdown of paid advertising performance across Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Ads, using a complete data workflow involving Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.
The goal was simple: identify which campaigns actually drive engagement, conversions, and ROI, instead of blindly spending ad budget.

What the project actually does

Consolidates raw ad-performance datasets from all three platforms.

Cleans, transforms, and models the data using SQL + Excel.

Builds interactive dashboards (Tableau + Power BI) to track real KPIs.

Compares platform performance based on reach, CTR, CPC, conversions, and ROI.

Highlights which campaigns deliver meaningful returns — and which ones waste budget.


KPIs Analyzed

Facebook: Reach, Impressions, Engagement Rate, CTR, Spend vs. ROI

LinkedIn: Engagement, Follower Growth, Clicks, B2B Conversion Metrics

Google Ads: CTR, Conversion Rate, CPC, ROAS


Key Insights

Facebook delivered the highest reach but inconsistent ROI due to variable engagement.

LinkedIn performed best for B2B-focused clicks and professional engagement.

Google Ads outperformed both platforms in ROI thanks to targeted search-based intent.

Major challenge: finding the balance between cost efficiency and audience engagement across platforms.


Impact

Helps marketing teams understand where to spend and where to stop wasting money.

Supports smarter ad-budget allocation supported by real metrics, not gut feeling.

Provides a reusable dashboard for continuous monitoring.
